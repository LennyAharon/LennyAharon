## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Lenny Aharon

I'm a PhD student in Statistics @ Columbia University â€” working at the intersection of **deep learning**, **computer vision**, and **computational neuroscience**. 

ðŸ§  I spend most of my time thinking about:
- Deep learning for video-based behavior analysis
- Multiview computer vision and pose estimation
- Machine learning for biomedical signal processing

Before all this, I was a pro soccer player. Now Iâ€™m training algorithms instead of abs âš½âžœðŸ“Š
